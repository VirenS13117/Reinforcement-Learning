# Reinforcement-Learning
This project contains various standard exercises of Reinforcement Learning and covers assignments from Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
Book by Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton.

Each exercise is challenging so I recommend book reading before civing into code. I have kept the scripts as simple and explainable as possible.
